# About

## Overview

This project is an ongoing Java application developed by Stefan V, designed to serve as a versatile and powerful tool for various tasks. While the application is still in its developmental phase, it already boasts several key features that demonstrate its potential.

## Key Features (Current)

- **Offline AI Assistant**: The app leverages Ollama, a sophisticated application capable of running Large Language  
Models (LLMs) directly on your computer without the need for an internet connection. This ensures privacy and  
reliability, especially in environments with limited or no internet access.
  
- **Chat Functionality**: Users can engage in interactive conversations with an LLM. Conversations can be saved and resumed at a later time, providing a seamless experience. Additionally, responses generated by the LLM can be easily copied and utilized elsewhere, enhancing productivity.
  
- **Presentation Generation**: The app includes a feature to automatically generate slides for presentations. In automatic mode, users only need to provide a topic, and the app will handle the rest, creating a structured and visually appealing presentation.

## Planned Features

- **DocVault**: This feature is intended to provide a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. While the UI already includes an option to select DocVault for more information, the functionality is still under development.
  
- **Plagiarism Checker**: Another planned feature is a plagiarism detection tool. Similar to DocVault, the UI allows users to select the Plagiarism Checker for additional details, but the functionality is yet to be implemented.

## Future Development

The development of this application is an ongoing process, with continuous improvements and new features being added.  
The planned features, such as DocVault and the Plagiarism Checker, are expected to significantly enhance the app's capabilities. Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated as I work towards delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly tool.
