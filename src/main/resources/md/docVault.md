# DocVault

## Overview

**DocVault** is a feature currently under development, designed to provide a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. While the user interface already includes an option to select DocVault for more  
information, the functionality is still in the process of being implemented.

## Purpose and Functionality

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

A RAG system is an advanced AI architecture that combines traditional information retrieval techniques with modern language generation models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text.  
This approach is particularly beneficial for tasks that require access to extensive knowledge bases or specific document collections.

### Key Features of DocVault

- **Document Retrieval**: DocVault will allow users to store documents within the system. These documents can then be retrieved and used as additional context for the language model.
  
- **Summarization**: One of the primary functionalities of DocVault will be the ability to summarize documents. By leveraging the RAG system, the app can generate concise and accurate summaries of long documents.
  
- **Question Answering**: Users will be able to ask questions about the content of the stored documents.  
The RAG system will retrieve relevant information from the documents and use it to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers.
  
- **Content Generation**: DocVault will enable the generation of new content based on the stored documents.  
This could include generating reports, articles, or other types of text that draw upon the information contained within the documents.

## Planned Enhancements

### User-Friendly Interface

- **Intuitive Design**: The user interface for DocVault will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to upload, manage, and interact with their documents.
  
- **Document Management**: Users will have the ability to organize their documents into folders, tag them for easy retrieval, and perform basic document management tasks such as renaming and deleting.

### Advanced Retrieval Techniques

- **Semantic Search**: DocVault will incorporate semantic search capabilities, allowing users to find documents based on meaning rather than just keywords.
  
- **Vector Similarity Search**: The system will use vector similarity search to identify documents that are semantically similar to a given query, enhancing the accuracy of information retrieval.

### Integration with Other Features

- **Chat Functionality**: DocVault will be integrated with the existing chat functionality, allowing users to ask questions about their documents directly within the chat interface.
  
- **Presentation Generation**: DocVault will be integrated with the presentation generation tool, enabling users to create presentations that draw upon the information in their documents.

## Future Development

The development of DocVault is an ongoing process, with continuous improvements and new features being added. Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated as I work towards delivering a comprehensive and  
user-friendly RAG system.
