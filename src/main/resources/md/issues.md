# Known Issues

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- **Theme Customization**  
  While the application allows users to switch between dark and light themes, not  
  all UI elements are consistently updated to reflect the chosen theme.  
  This inconsistency can lead to a disjointed visual experience.
  <br>
  <br>
- **Chat Management**  
  The current user interface lacks a built-in feature to delete stored conversations.  
  Users are required to manually edit the `.conversations.json` file located in the  
  persistence folder to remove unwanted conversations. This process is not intuitive  
  and may deter less technically inclined users.
  <br>
  <br>
- **Window Maximization**  
  Upon maximizing the application window, the app does not retain the previous  
  window size, leading to a loss of user-defined preferences.  
  <br>  
  Additionally, in some instances, the window may not render correctly,  
  necessitating resizing or maximizing to restore proper display.  
  <br>
  <br>

## Unimplemented Features

The user interface currently indicates the presence of features that have not yet  
been implemented, specifically the **DocVault** and **Plagiarism Checker**.  
These functionalities are slated for development in the near future and are  
expected to enhance the overall utility and appeal of the application.  
  <br>
Should you have any additional features in mind that you believe would further  
enrich the application's functionality and user experience, please do not hesitate  
to share your thoughts. Your feedback is invaluable in guiding the ongoing  
development and refinement of this tool.
