#   This file is used to tell the LLM how to generate content for the sub-topics

#   You can make changes, but make sure the instructions still contain the following variables:
#   ${topic},${subTopics} and ${currentSubTopic},
#   and also define the format of the response.

Please help me with the content for a presentation about the following topic:
${topic}

The presentation will have the following sub-topics:
${subTopics}

However, for now let's just focus on this sub-topic:
${currentSubTopic}

Please generate content for the slides for this subtopic. Only give me the text that should be on the slides (Key points, a few sentences, etc.), nothing else. Not less than 3 slides and not more than 7.

And strictly follow this format:

--------------------------

Slide [slide number]
### Title for the slide
Content for the slide

--------------------------

Slide [slide number]
### Title for the slide
Content for the slide

--------------------------

Slide [slide number]
### Title for the slide
Content for the slide

--------------------------

... and so on.

And use markdown to format and structure the text.
