#   You can make changes, but make sure the instructions still contain ${topic}

Please suggest sub-topics for a presentation about the following topic:
${topic}

It should be at least three sub-topics, but not more than eight. Please use one line for each sub-topic suggestion and follow the following format:

[sub-topic title] : [sub-topic description]

reply only with the sub-topic list, nothing else
